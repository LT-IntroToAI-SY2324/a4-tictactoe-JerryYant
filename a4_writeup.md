# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
doing the has_won function
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would make a function where you would call it by typing in "Play computer" which would start it.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
at first make the computer place a mark in a random sector, then make it go through the list and see which spots that are open have a mark which it is using next to or diagnolay and place it in that place.
